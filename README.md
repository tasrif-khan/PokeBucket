# PokeBucket
Java based GUI program using JavaFX and sqlite to display a pokedex and track your own collection!

Browse through the entire pokedex and search for a pokemon by either type or abilities.

Add a pokemon to your collection that you might have across different games.



TO-DO:

Add sprites to each pokemon.

Improve searching to be eassier.

Add gender information, but have constraints for legendaries that do not have one or specific pokemon (EX: Nidorina)
